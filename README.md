# Henya-The-Genius-Riddle-Solver



Got this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrwtzuKUkRg) in my recommended of Henya the Genius playing Silent Hill 3, and actually being a real genius.
So before watching it to the end to see the solution, I wanted to write a program to find it out.

The normal version of the puzzle gives these two hints:

    "The first is larger than the second;
    the second twice the third;
    the third smaller than the fourth;
    the fourth is half the first.


    "Four of the numbers are not repeated
    Three are not in the top row
    Two are not in the right row
    One of the numbers is the final key"

Keypad looks like this, and is not a "normal" modern keypad with a 0 and two extra function buttons. It only contains the number 1 - 9.

    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9
